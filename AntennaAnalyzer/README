These are sketches for a homebrew antenna analyzer.

Based on code originally by J M Harvey.
See https://github.com/jmharvey1/DDS_AD9850_AntennaAnalyzer

Programs:

AntAnalyzerSerial.ino: Measures SWR etc. over a range of frequencies,
outputs parameters to serial port. Can also output in CSV format
suitable for importing into a spreadsheet.

AntAnalyzerLCD.ino: Measures SWR etc. over a range of frequencies,
outputs to a 2x16 serial LCD connected to pins using software serial
library.

AntAnalyzerLCDEncoder.ino: Measures SWR at a specific frequency.
Outputs to a 2x16 serial LCD connected to pins using software serial
library. Can set frequency using rotary encoder with switch.

PARTS LIST:

ATMEGA328 programmed with Arduino boot loader.
KY-040 Optical Rotary encoder with switch.
AD9850 DDS module.
2X16 Serial LCD 5V TTL level.
FTDI board (e.g. AdaFruit or RobotShop) set for 5V.
